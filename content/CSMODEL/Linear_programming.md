## Linear programming

- Linear programming is used for obtaining the most optimal solution for a problem with given constraints.

1. Identify the **decision variables**.
2. Write the **objective function**
3. Identify the **constraints**
4. Explicitly state the **non-negativity restriction**.

- Note: all functions must be linear.

### Decision variables

- The decision variables are variables that impacts the output.
- To solve any problem, the decision variables must be identified first.

### Objective function

- **Objective of making decisions** (e.g. **profit**)

### Constraints

- Restrictions or limitations on the decision variables (e.g. limited availability)

### Non-negativity restriction

- Decision variables should always be **non-negative**.
