## Data

- **Data** refers to pieces of facts and statistics collected and recorded for the purpose of analysis
- Data is used to answer questions and is collected for that purpose
- We model data so that it becomes something we can understand and rocess

### Dataset

- A **dataset** is a collection of related pieces of data

<!--ID: 1750738628311-->
### Types of data

- **Categorical** vs **numerical**

<!--ID: 1750738628313-->
#### Categorical data

- **Descriptive** information that may take on several distinct categories
- May be **ordinal** or **nominal**

<!--ID: 1750738628315-->
##### Ordinal data

- Categorical data with a sense of ordering

<!--ID: 1750738628317-->
##### Nominal data

- Nominal data without a sense of ordering

<!--ID: 1750738628319-->
#### Numerical data

- **Numerical** information that can be objectively measured
- Can be **discrete** or **continuous**

<!--ID: 1750738628321-->
##### Discrete data

- Numerical data that can take on specific values in a set

<!--ID: 1750738628323-->
##### Continuous data

- Numerical data that can take on any numeric value within a range

<!--ID: 1750738628325-->
### Forms of data

- Structured
- Unstructured
- Graph-based
- Language
- Audio and video
- Generated

<!--ID: 1750738628327-->
#### Structured data

- **Structured data** adheres to some structured model
- Tabular

<!--ID: 1750738628329-->
#### Unstructured data

- **Unstructured data** does **not** adhere to a standardized format

<!--ID: 1750738628331-->
#### Graph-based data

- **Graph-based data** are represented as pairwise relationships between objects

<!--ID: 1750738628333-->
#### Natural language

- Information expressed in natural human language

<!--ID: 1750738628334-->
#### Audio and video data

- Data not represented in a text format (audio, video)

<!--ID: 1750738628336-->
#### Generated data

- Generated/recorded by applications without human intervention

<!--ID: 1750738628338-->
## Data modelling

- Preprocessing steps performed on data in order to make use of data
- Motivated by some overarching research question

- Step-by-step:
	1. Begin with raw real-world data
	2. Load into computer representation of data
	3. Represent with some mathematical model
	4. Make conclusions, inferences, transformations, and insights

<!--ID: 1750738628340-->
### Research question

- Data modelling should be backed up with a **research question** that drives every decision in the project
- Should be:
	- **Clear, concise**, easy to understand, and free of technical jargon
	- **Feasible**, meaning it should be answerable with the available data and resources
	- **Meaningful**, addressing a real problem instead of something trivial
