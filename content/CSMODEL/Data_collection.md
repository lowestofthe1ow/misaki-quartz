## Data collection

- Data collected by other people (public/private sources) vs data collected by you (observational study/experiments)
- Data may be collected not for a specific purpose already in mind, but just for potential analysis in the future
- Data could also already exist somewhere in the world, waiting to be collected for some purpose

<!--ID: 1750738628344-->
### Observational study

- Data where no treatment has been explicitly applied
- The data is collected in a way that **does not interfere** with the resulting data
- Can only establish **correlation** (a relationship between variables that is **not necessarily** a cause-and-effect relationship)

<!--ID: 1750738628347-->
### Experiment

- Data collected from studies where treatments are assigned to cases
- Treated experimental group vs. untreated control group
- Can be used to conclude **causation** by isolating all other variables aside from the one being treated

## Sampling

<!--ID: 1750738628351-->
### Population

- The **population** refers to the entire group of elements to which you intend to generalize your data.
- Ideally, data should be collected from the entire population. However, this is often not possible.

<!--ID: 1750738628353-->
### Sample

- A **sample** is some subset of the population that is taken to represent the entire population.
- If selected properly, any findings within the sample may be generalized to the entire population.
- Generally should be chosen randomly to avoid biases.

<!--ID: 1750738628355-->
#### Convenience bias

- Occurs when only the data that is easy to collect is included in the sample.

<!--ID: 1750738628357-->
#### Non-response bias

- Some chosen participants are unwilling to give data

<!--ID: 1750738628359-->
#### Voluntary response bias

- Only people who are willing to volunteer are included in the sample

<!--ID: 1750738628361-->
#### Exclusion bias

- Some groups of people are deliberately excluded to participate in the data collection.

<!--ID: 1750738628363-->
#### Simple random sampling

- Randomly select observations from the population

<!--ID: 1750738628364-->
#### Stratified random sampling

1. Arrange the population according to some meaningful groups of data
	- Groups are called **strata**
	- Members in a stratum are homogeneous within the stratum
	- Members of a stratum are heterogeneous from members of another stratum
2. Randomly sample from each group

>[!important] The choice of **strata** is imposed by the research question.
> e.g. dividing population of university students by what university they attend to find out differences between those universities

>[!important] The sizes of the strata should be proportional to their relative sizes within the population

<!--ID: 1750738628366-->
#### Cluster sampling

1. Divide a population into natural groups (clusters)
2. Choose clusters to include in the sample

>[!important] The choice of clusters is natural and unrelated to the research question

Advantage of using cluster sampling: It's more practical; easier to collect samples from a single cluster

Clusters are still chosen randomly.

Like stratified, sizes clusters should be proportional to their relative sizes within the population

#### Multistage sampling

1. Perform cluster sampling (stage 1)
2. Randomly sample from the selected clusters (stage 2)
