## What is a statement?

All C programs are made up of a [[Problem_analysis,_logic_formulation_and_flowcharting#Algorithm design / Setting up algorithms to solve problems|sequence of instructions]]. In C, instructions are also called statements. In the English language, a statement is terminated by a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point. In C, a statement is terminated by a semicolon.

## What is the use of `/* */` symbols?

These symbols group [[Tokens_and_token_classification#Comments|comments]] inside the program. Comments are not instructions, rather they simply provide additional information (a textual description) such as what the program is doing, what are the inputs and outputs, etc. Comments are optional and may be placed anywhere within the program source code.
