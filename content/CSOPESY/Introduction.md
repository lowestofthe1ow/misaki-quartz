## Operating systems

- A computer system can be divided into **hardware**, the **operating system**, **application programs**, and a **user**.
- The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use
- Alternatively, a computer system can be viewed as consisting of hardware, software, and data.
	- The operating system provides a convenient and efficient environment for executing programs

## User view

- The OS is a frontend for the user
- The user view varies by device (e.g. PCs aim for ease of use and performance while embeded systems try to run without user intervention)

## System view

- The operating system is the program most intimately involved with the hardware
	- The OS is a resource allocator and aw control program

## Kernel 

- The core of the OS --- the program that is running at all times

## Computer-system organization

- Typical system consists of one or more CPUs and device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access between components and shared memory.
- The OS has a device driver for each device or controller.
