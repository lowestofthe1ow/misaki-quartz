### History as inquiry

**Memory is not history but they can be sources of history**

It is the role of the historian to choose among which memories can be included in the historical narrative

Propaganda is not history

Zeus Salazar, a Filipino historian and proponent of

Pantayong Pananaw, defined kasaysayan as:"isang salaysay

na may saysay para sa isang grupo ng tao na

pinagsasalaysayan nito."

Salaysay

Saysay

Para sa pinagsasalaysayan

The use of language, particularly a language common to

both the historian and the reader, is very important in

Pantayong Pananaw.

The term "Pantayong Pananaw" came from the root word

"tayo" (us/we), a pronoun which includes both the

speaker and the receiver.

This is a reaction to how Philippine history, in the past,

has been written in the point of view of Westerners.

Code of Kalantiaw

There are patterns, but history does not repeat itself.
