Why is the PSEi stock market index important and worth academic research?

- The selection process for the 30 component companies is rigorous and is subject to revision at least twice a year, typically in February and August.

Why is the PSEi more important/interesting than other ASEAN stock market indices?

How does the PSEi react to external events (for example, global financial crises) compared to other ASEAN stock market indices?

- Resilience to purely financial shocks (e.g. global financial crises), vulnerability to real economic shocks (e.g. COVID)






Has the PSEi been neglected in academic research on finance and investment? Why? Why is this negligence unreasonable?  

- Yes, the PSEi has been relatively neglected in mainstream academic finance literature compared to its regional peers. Unlike Singapore or Thailand, the PSEi is less researched internationally, offering novel academic contributions.
- The PSEi offers unique insights into the behavior of frontier/emerging markets.
- As outlined above, the Philippine economy's structure (remittances, consumption, demographics) is unique. Ignoring it creates a selection bias in academic research, limiting the generalizability of theories tested only on other ASEAN markets.
- Its distinct features make it an ideal "natural laboratory" to test hypotheses about how specific economic structures (e.g., a remittance-driven economy) influence financial market behavior, which is invaluable for economic science.

Why is the PSEi important to foreign institutional and individual investors (for example, in New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.)?

- Diversification
- Liquidity and accessibility
- Strategic ASEAN presence
