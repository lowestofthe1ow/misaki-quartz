The Philippine economy can also be considered rather resilient to external shocks, particularly to financial crises. The 1997 Asian financial crisis did not affect the country's economy as severely as some of its neighbors'. Despite the crisis' noticeable impact on issues such as national poverty, the economy itself was more prepared, and therefore resilient, to adverse effects [1, 2]. This resilience may stem from a number of factors, such as a strong foreign reserve [3]. It may also be explained by the use of a floating exchange rate system, favorable conditions before the crash that made asset bubbles less likely to form, a lower vulnerability to external debt, and economic reforms that built upon the lessons learned from the financial crisis over a decade prior in 1983 [1, 4].
