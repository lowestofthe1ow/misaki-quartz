Scope and limitations outline:
- We will focus on the usage of Adlai in specific
- We will be using banana and papaya amendments
- We will focus on only loam soil

what will be compared when putting the peels versus other fertilizers so the limitations cld be like we wont compare their composition just how good they are at doing their job Oh the time itll take to conduct the study thats one too So maybe like say we estimate it to be over the course of a month And where itll be conducted so just say lasalle university for that


This study will focus on the usage of dehydrated and powdered organic amendments produced from banana and papaya peels to enhance the quality of loam soil for growing Adlai crops. The study will not use any other types of amendments. It will also focus solely on loam soil; other soil types, such as sandy soil or clay soil, will not be taken into account. The only comparative analysis to be performed will be against other, commercially-available fertilizers. The experiments that demonstrate Adlai growth will be performed with the facilities of De La Salle University and is estimated to take about one month. Necessary data such as the effectiveness of amendments will be extracted during the experimentation process.
