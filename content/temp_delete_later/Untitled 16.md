## Pencil and paper

represent both multiplicand (m) and multiplier (n) using 2’s
complement format
2.) the first intermediate product has a length of m+n bits. Sign
extend as needed
3.) As with pencil-and-paper multiplication, succeeding
intermediate products are shifted right
4.) if the multiplier is negative, add the 2’s complement of the
multiplicand, sign-extended and shifted to sign-bit position
