## Supervised learning

- In supervised learning, the dataset is a collection of **labeled examples**.



## Linear regression

- Produces a model that is some linear combination of the features of the input example: $$\{ (\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^N$$
- Here the **label** $y_i$ is a **real-valued target**.
