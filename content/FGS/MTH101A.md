**Problem 1.** Find the solution sets for the following.

$$

3.
$$
\frac{5}{9 - x} + \frac{3}{x + 9} + \frac{3x + 8}{x^2 - 81} = 0
$$

4.

$$

**Problem 4.** Prove the change-of-base identity, that is:

$$
\log_b{x} = \frac{log_a{x}}{log_a{b}}
$$

**Problem 5.** Determine the center, vertices, and foci of the ellipse described by the following relation:

$$
\frac{(x - 5)^2}{81} + \frac{(y + 2)^2}{49} = 1
$$

**Problem 6.** Find the values of all six trigonometric functions of $\theta$ given each of the following conditions.

1.

$$

2.
$$
\sin{\theta} = \frac{4}{5}, \
0 < \theta < \pi
$$

**Problem 7.** Show that the following identities hold. These problems were taken from [Verifying trigonometric identities (LibreTexts)](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Monroe_Community_College/MTH_165_College_Algebra_MTH_175_Precalculus/06%3A_Analytic_Trigonometry/6.03%3A_Verifying_Trigonometric_Identities).

1.
$$
(1 - \cos^2{x})(1 + \cot^2{x}) = 1
$$

2.
$$
\frac{\sec^2{\theta} - 1}{\sec^2{\theta}} = \sin^2{\theta}
$$
