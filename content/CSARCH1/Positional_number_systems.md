## Positional number system

A **positional number system** is a system that offers unique symbols with which a number may be represented. The number of such unique symbols is called the **radix** or base of that system.

>[!info] The largest-valued symbol always has a magnitude of one less than the radix (i.e., base 10 allows for symbols 0 to 9).

### Position and value

**Position** is denoted to start at 0 at the **left** side of the radix point, incrementing by 1 thereafter. Position is denoted to start at $-1$ from the **right** side of the radix point, decrementing by 1 thereafter. For instance, for the value $124.54$:

```
         1 2 4 . 5  4
Position 2 1 0   -1 -2
```

A position's **place value** is the base raised to the position; a digit's value is the digit multiplied by its place value.

### Decimal (denary)

The **decimal** or **denary** system has a radix of **10** and symbols 0 to 9. Decimal values are subscripted with 10 (as in $124.5_{10}$, but this is usually dropped as 124.5 on its own is assumed to be in decimal) or prefixed or suffixed with $0$ or $0d$.

### Binary

The **binary** system has a radix of **2** and symbols 0 and 1.
