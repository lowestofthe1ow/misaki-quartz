## Intelligent Systems

- **Intelligent systems** are computational systems that perceive their environment, evaluate, and decide their actions in ways that a human would
<!--ID: 1750164579904-->
### Artificial intelligence

- **Artificial intelligence** is the backbone of intelligent systems.
	- It is the study of how machines can exhibit at least one aspect associated with intelligent behavior (e.g. problem solving, reasoning, and learning)
<!--ID: 1750164579907-->
#### Problem solving

- **Problem solving** refers to the performance of non-trivial goal-directed tasks
<!--ID: 1750164579909-->
#### Reasoning

- **Reasoning** refers to drawing logical inferences from facts
<!--ID: 1750164579911-->
#### Learning

- **Learning** refers to improvement of performance through experience
<!--ID: 1750164579913-->
## Modelling inference learning paradigm

- Produce a **model** from a **real-world problem**
	- This model may be **fine-tuned**
- The **model** will be the means to obtaining a solution

### Modelling

- **Modelling** refers to the problem of representing a real-world task as an abstract model.
<!--ID: 1750164579917-->
### Inference

- **Inference** refers to answering questions or finding solutions through systematic algorithm runs on the model.
<!--ID: 1750164579919-->
### Learning

- Models may be **fine-tuned** based on historical data.

## Intellectual traditions in AI
<!--ID: 1750164579923-->
### Symbolic AI

- **Top-down approach**
- Identify and model the "rules" of the problem.
- Find a solution based on those rules.
<!--ID: 1750164579925-->
### Neural AI

- **Bottom-up approach**
- Start with examples (data) and feed them to the model.
- Adjust the model's "rules" based on the data.
<!--ID: 1750164579927-->
### Statistical AI

- **Mathematicians' view**
- Provides mathematical rigor to AI approaches.
<!--ID: 1750164579929-->
## Types of AI models
<!--ID: 1750164579930-->
### Reflex-Based Models:

  - Single-pass processing of input features to map it to an output.
<!--ID: 1750164579932-->
### State-Based Models:

  - Represent the problem as a set of states to search through.
<!--ID: 1750164579934-->
### Variable-Based Models:

  - Represent the problem as a set of constraints to satisfy.
<!--ID: 1750164579936-->
### Logic-Based Models:

  - Automatic deduction and reasoning based on known facts.
<!--ID: 1750164579938-->
## The Turing Test

- Introduced in a 1950 landmark paper by **Alan Turing**
- A human evaluator (**C**) talks with a machine (**A**) and a human (**B**).
- C cannot see A or B and they must communicate by typewritten messages.
- C will try to guess who is the machine.
- A must convince C that A is not the machine.
