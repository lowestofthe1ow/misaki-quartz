## Names

A **name** or **identifier** is a string of characters that identify some entity.

>[!info] Not all variables have names. Some are **anonymous**.

The primary design issues for names are **case sensitivity**, **name length**, and their classifications as keywords or **reserved words**.

### Special words

Makes programs more readable; names actions to be performed. In most languages, they are classified as [[Tokens_and_token_classification#Keywords|reserved words]] (notable exception being Fortran, which had no reserved words)

## Variable

**Variables** are an **abstraction** of computer memory cells or a collection of cells. They serve to replace absolute numeric memory addresses for data with names.
<!--ID: 1727924287873-->

### Variable attributes

Name, address, type, value, lifetime, scope

<!--ID: 1727924287876-->

### Address (l-value)

This is the memory address that the variable is associated with

A variable may have different addresses at different times in execution.

**We can have multiple addresses as the same variable**.

### Type

Range of values that can be stored

<!--ID: 1727924287881-->

### Value (r-value)

The value stored at the address

<!--ID: 1727924287884-->

## Binding

**Binding** is the association between an attribute and an entity
<!--ID: 1727924287886-->

## Allocation

Getting a memory cell

<!--ID: 1727924287917-->

## Deallocation

Putting a memory cell back into the pool

<!--ID: 1727924287920-->

## Lifetime

The time wherein a variable is bound to a particular memory cell

<!--ID: 1727924287924-->

## Static variables

Static variables are bound to memory before execution

<!--ID: 1727924287927-->

## Scope

The range of statements wherein a variable is **visible**.
