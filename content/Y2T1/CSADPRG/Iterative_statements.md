## Iterative statements

Causes statements to be executed zero ([[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `while` statement|while loops]]), one, or more times ([[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `do` statement|do-while loops]])

The primary categories are defined by how designers answered two basicdesign questions:

- How is the iteration controlled?
- Where should the control mechanism appear in the loop statement?

The primary possibilities for iteration control are **logical**, **counting**, or a combination of the two. The main choices for the location of the control mechanism are the top of the loop or the bottom of the loop.

### Logical vs counting

Logical - `while`; counting - `for`

Although logically controlled loops are more general than counter-controlled loops, they are not necessarily more commonly used. Because counter-controlled loops are more complex, their design is more demanding.

### Location of control mechanism

See [[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `while` statement|while loops]] (**pre-test**) vs [[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `do` statement|do-while loops]] (**post-test**)

### Body

Single statement or collection of statements

<!--ID: 1728275348084-->

### Loop variable

*See also*: [[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements|Iterative statements]]

In early versions of C (pre-C99), the definition of the loop variable must be outside of the `for` statement

```c
/* C99 */
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    /* Loop body */
}
```

The  **initial value** is `0`, the **terminal value** is `5`, and the **step size** is `1` (increment). These are referred to as the loop parameters.

>[!tip] Counter-controlled loops are sometimes supported by machine instruc- tions designed for that purpose. Unfortunately, machine architecture can out- live the prevailing approaches to programming at the time of the architecture design.

Only the initial value is evaluated exactly once

There is no explicit loop variable and no loop parameters (All of the expressions of Câ€™s for are optional but this can result is code that is syntactically correct yet semantically incorrect). All involved variables can be changed in the loop body. The expressions are evaluated in the order stated previously. Although it can create havoc, it is legal to branch into a C for loop body (comma operator).

####


- What are the type and scope of the loop variable?
- Should it be legal for the loop variable or loop parameters to be changed in the loop, and if so, does the change affect loop control?
- Should the loop parameters be evaluated only once, or once for every iteration?

## Python's `for`

```python
for loop_variable in object:
<!--ID: 1728275348091-->
# loop body
[else:
# else clause]
```

`object` - array slices; uses range function with parameters start, **stop**, and step

## Counter-controlled loops in functional languages

[[Recurrences|Recursion]]

```f#
let rec forLoop loopBody reps =
if reps <= 0 then
()
else
loopBody()
forLoop loopBody, (reps - 1);;
```

<!--ID: 1728275348098-->

## Logically controlled loops

- Should the control be pretest or posttest?
- Should the logically controlled loop be a special form of a counting loop or a separate statement?
<!--ID: 1728275348102-->

## User-located loop control

- Should the conditional mechanism be an integral part of the exit?
- Should only one loop body be exited, or can enclosing loops also be exited?

`break` breaks control out of an enclosing switch or loop

`continue` breaks control out of the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next

<!--ID: 1728275348106-->

## Iteration based on data structures

Controlled by number of elements

Calls an iterator function to get the next element in the structure

Example: C tree traversal (pointers; `traverse()` is the iterator)

```c
for (ptr = root; ptr == null; ptr = traverse(ptr)) {
. . .
}
```
