## Why study programming languages?

- Increased capacity to express ideas
- Improved background for choosing appropriate languages
- Increased ability to learn new languages
- Better understanding of the significance of implementation
- Better use of languages that are already known
- Overall advancement of computing

## Programming as a skill

Exposure to multiple programming language features helps develop one's thinking process. Programming as a **skill** involves the areas of **logic** and **syntax**. Studying programming languages leads to an **increased capacity to express ideas**.

### Logic

**Logic** is knowing **what to do**.

### Syntax

**Syntax** is knowing how to **express** what to do. A programming language limits one's ability to express a specific idea to a certain syntax. In other words, **syntax is a limit on logic**.

## Choosing the appropriate language

Forcing the simulation of features in a programming language that wasn't designed to support it will lead to a mess that is horrible to design, implement, and maintain. For instance, just because there are ways to simulate classes in C does not mean we should do so. Studying programming languages leads to an **improved background for choosing appropriate languages**

## Learning a new language

Because the tech industry is rapidly changing, one must be prepared to learn new concepts and adapt to changes. Learning a new language is tedious, but understanding the foundations of programming languages will lead to an **increased ability to learn new languages**.
