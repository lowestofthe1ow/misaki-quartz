## Iterative statements

**Iterative statements** cause statements to be executed zero ([[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `while` statement|while loops]]), one, or more times ([[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `do` statement|do-while loops]]) The primary categories are defined by how designers answered two basic design questions:

- How is the iteration **controlled**?
- **Where** should the control mechanism appear in the loop statement?

The primary possibilities for iteration control are **logical**, **counting**, or a combination of the two. The main choices for the location of the control mechanism are the top of the loop or the bottom of the loop.

### Logical

**Logical iterative statements** are usually denoted by `while`. They are controlled by a Boolean expression (hence "logical"). Although logical iterative statements are more general than counter-controlled loops, they are not necessarily more commonly used.

### Counter-controlled

**Counter-controlled iterative statements** are usually denoted by `for`. Because counter-controlled loops are more complex, their design is usually more demanding.

### Location of control mechanism

The location of the control mechanism dictates when the loop tests for a condition; see [[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `while` statement|while loops]] (known as **pre-test**) vs [[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements#The `do` statement|do-while loops]] (known as **post-test**)

### Body

The body of an iterative statement refers to all of the statements contained under it.

### Loop variable

*See also*: [[Y1T1/CCPROG1/Iterative_statements|Iterative statements]]

In early versions of C (pre-C99), the definition of the loop variable must be outside of the `for` statement

```c
/* C99 */
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    /* Loop body */
}
```

The **initial value** is `0`, the **terminal value** is `5`, and the **step size** is `1` (increment). These are referred to as the loop parameters.

>[!tip] Counter-controlled loops are sometimes supported by machine instructions designed for that purpose. Unfortunately, machine architecture can outlive the prevailing approaches to programming at the time of the architecture design.

>[!info] Notes
>- Only the initial value is evaluated exactly once.
>- There is no explicit loop variable and no loop parameters (All of the expressions of Câ€™s for are optional but this can result is code that is syntactically correct yet semantically incorrect).
>- All involved variables can be changed in the loop body.
>- The expressions are evaluated in the order stated previously.
>- Although it can create havoc, it is legal to branch into a C for loop body (comma operator).

## Python's `for` loop

```python
for loop_variable in object:
...
[else:
...
]
```

Python's `for` loop iterates over some `object`. Counting loops are usually implemented through array slices and the `range` function (with parameters start, **stop**, and step)

## Counter-controlled loops in functional languages

Counter-controlled loops in functional languages may be implemented [[Recurrences|recursively]].

```f#
let rec forLoop loopBody reps =
if reps <= 0 then
()
else
loopBody()
forLoop loopBody, (reps - 1);;
```

## Logically controlled loops

- Should the control be pretest or posttest?
- Should the logically controlled loop be a special form of a counting loop or a separate statement?
<!--ID: 1728275348102-->

## User-located loop control

- Should the conditional mechanism be an integral part of the exit?
- Should only one loop body be exited, or can enclosing loops also be exited?

`break` breaks control out of an enclosing switch or loop

`continue` breaks control out of the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next

<!--ID: 1728275348106-->

## Iteration based on data structures

Controlled by number of elements

Calls an iterator function to get the next element in the structure

Example: C tree traversal (pointers; `traverse()` is the iterator)

```c
for (ptr = root; ptr == null; ptr = traverse(ptr)) {
. . .
}
```
