## File-based systems

Application software communicates with **files** (text and binary). Only one type of record is stored in one file. The application is coded with data management functions.

## Database systems

A **database system** comprises the following components:

-   A database
-   A database management system (DBMS)
-   A [[Fundamentals_of_data_and_information#Database applications|database application]]

While the database system encompasses all three components, the term **database server** is used to refer only to the database and the database management system. Note that the database server may be on a different machine from that of the database application.

> [!info] When interacting with the database, we do not see the **physical** representation of the data storage, only its **logical** representation. 1
