## Data

**Data** is the quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, i.e., raw facts without context.

## Database applications

A **database application** collects data and transforms it to information. It should be able to provide its users of what they need or want to know about the data, i.e., it contextualizes it.

### Applications development

Creating a computer program or a set of program to perform a task.

### Database application anatomy

<!--ID: 1726155954398-->

#### Single monolithic application

A **single monolithic application** is the most basic form of a database application. The **data-based** application handles **all** of the following:

- Input
- Output
- Computations
- Validation
- Implementation of rules
- Report generation
- Reading, updating, and deletion of data
<!--ID: 1726155954402-->

#### Client-server

The **client-server anatomy** is often used in desktop-based database applications. Unlike monolithic applications, reading, updating, and deletion of data is offloaded to a **database server**.

#### 3-tier architecture

**3-tier architecture** is often used in web-based database applications. It offloads input and output to a separate tier as follows:
