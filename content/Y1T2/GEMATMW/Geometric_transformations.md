## Reflection

The original figure has a mirror image that is of the same distance on the other side of the axis of reflection.

### Reflection across the x-axis

Point $(a, b)$ is shifted into $(a, -b)$

<!--ID: 1707552691702-->

### Reflection across the y-axis

Point $(a, b)$ is shifted into $(-a, b)$

<!--ID: 1707552691707-->

### Reflection across the line $y=x$

Point $(a, b)$ is shifted into $(b, a)$

<!--ID: 1707552691711-->

## Translation

In a translation or a slide, all the points in the figure are moved the same distance and the same direction.

If $(a, b)$ is slid $c$ units horizontally and $d$ units vertically, $(a, b)$ is shifted into $(a + c, b +d)$. In other notation, $T_{(c,d)}$

## Glide reflection

It is a transformation that is formed by first applying reflection across an axis and then translation **in the same direction** as the axis.

## Rotation

It is a transformation that turns a figure about a fixed point called the center of rotation. A rotation is sometimes called a **turn**.

### 90-degree rotation given center $(0,0)$

$(x,y)$ is rotated into $(-y,x)$

<!--ID: 1707552691728-->

### 180-degree rotation given center $(0,0)$

$(x,y)$ is rotated into $(-x,-y)$

<!--ID: 1707552691732-->

### 270-degree rotation given center $(0,0)$

$(x,y)$ is rotated into $(y,-x)$

<!--ID: 1707552691736-->

### $\theta$-degree rotation counter-clockwise given center $(0,0)$

$(x,y)$ is rotated into $(x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta, x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta)$

<!--ID: 1707552691740-->

### Rotational symmetry

If a geometric figure has a rotational symmetry, the order of its rotational symmetry is defined as the number of times it matches with itself as it is rotated around a full circle. 

<!--ID: 1707552691745-->

## Dilation

A transformation such that $(x, y)$ dilates into $(kx, ky)$ where $k$ is a nonzero constant known as the **scale factor**. The original figure and its image are similar but of different sizes if $k\leq 1$

<!--ID: 1707552691748-->

### Expansion

Dilation where $k>1$

<!--ID: 1707552691752-->

### Contraction

Dilation where $0<k<1$
