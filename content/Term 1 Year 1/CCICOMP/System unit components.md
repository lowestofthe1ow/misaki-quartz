## System unit

The system unit or **chassis** refers to the case that contains and protects the motherboard, hard disk drive, memory, and other hardware components.

### Motherboard

The motherboard, sometimes called a system board, is the main circuit board of the computer. Many electronic components, such as the processor and memory, are attached to the motherboard; others are built into it.

### Central processing unit

The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is sometimes called the brain of the computer. It is usually a silicon chip about the size of a thumbnail. It fits into the motherboard's CPU socket, which is covered by the heatsink that absorbs heat from the CPU and fan to dissipate the heat.

### Chipset

The chipset controls the communication between the CPU, memory, storage, and other peripherals (e.g. keyboard, mouse, or monitor). The chipset determines how many high-speed components or devices the motherboard can support.

### Random access memory (RAM)

The random access memory (RAM), also called the **main memory**, temporarily stores data whenever the computer performs operations. Contents of the memory disappears when the computer is turned off.

### Hard disk drive

The hard disk drive, is a long-term storage that holds data even when the computer is turned off. In some computers, specially laptops, a **solid-state drive** is used.

### Power supply

The power supply unit, or laptop AC adapter, converts electricity from the outlet (AC 1 20 or 220 volts) to a type of power (DC 5 to 15 volts) that the computer can use. Different motherboards and computers require different wattages on the power supply. In desktop computers, power supply has built-in fans that keeps the power supply cool.

### Expansion slots

Most motherboards have built-in **video**, **sound**, and **network** capabilities. However, in certain cases, the user might want to improve the performance and capabilities of a computer. In such cases, motherboards have **expansion slots** that allows users to add various types of expansion cards or adapter cards.

<!--ID: 1701506387533-->


#### Modem

Connects to transmission media, e.g., television or phone lines
<!--ID: 1701506387537-->


#### Network

Provides network connections, such as an Ethernet port
<!--ID: 1701506387542-->


#### Sound

Connects to speakers or microphone
<!--ID: 1701506387546-->


#### USB

Connects to high speed USB ports
<!--ID: 1701506387551-->


#### Video

Usually have a GPU (graphics processing unit) to enhance computer graphics capabilities such as
accelerated processing or to connect to an additional monitor
<!--ID: 1701506387556-->


### Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)

The Peripheral Component Interconnect, or PCI, is the input/output pathway that connects the **CPU**, via the expansion slots, to the **peripheral devices**.
<!--ID: 1701506387561-->


### Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA)

The Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, or SATA, is a computer bus interface used to connect **drive disk controllers** or host bus adapters with **mass storage devices** like optical drives and hard disk drives.
<!--ID: 1701506387566-->


### Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Battery

The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor, also known as CMOS battery, is responsible for **keeping all the information intact when the entire system is shut down**. This prevents reconfiguration when the PC is powered off.

### Processor and Multicore Technology

The processor interprets and carries out basic instructions that operate a computer. On large computer systems, such as mainframes and supercomputers, the various functions performed by the processor extend over many separate chips and multiple circuit boards. On a personal computer system, all functions of the processor usually are on a single chip, called a microprocessor.

#### Processor Core

A processor core contains the circuitry necessary to execute instructions. The operating system views each processor core as a separate processor.
<!--ID: 1701506387580-->


#### Multicore Processor

A multicore processor is a single chip with two or more processor cores.
<!--ID: 1701506387584-->


#### Control Unit

The control unit is the component of the processor that directs and coordinates most of the operations in the computer. It interprets each instruction issued by a program and then initiates the appropriate action to carry out the instruction.
<!--ID: 1701506387587-->


#### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is the component of the processor that performs arithmetic and logic operations. Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logic operations encompass comparison operations like greater than, less than, or equal to.
