**"It is not SAD if you sell in May: Seasonal effects in stock markets revisited,"**

Based on daily data from 75 stock markets during the period 2000–2014 there is a strong calendar effect in a large majority of the markets as the period from November to April witnesses higher returns than do the other six months of the year. However, there is only weak evidence that SAD had any effect on stock prices. The paper shows that Halloween Effect seems to be remarkably con-
sistent, even after being widely discussed, and both statistically and economically significant. However, it remains unexplained. The SAD hypothesis finds less support in the data and seems of limited relevance economically.

**"The Halloween indicator, "Sell in May and go away": another puzzle,"**

Based on the old market saying “Sell in May and go away” (or the Halloween indicator), we found that there is a substantial difference between returns in the period May–October and the remainder of the year. In fact our evidence shows that while during the period November–April returns are large in most countries, average returns in the period May–October are not significantly different from zero and are often even negative.
