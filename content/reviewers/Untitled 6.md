**I. Multiple choice.** Determine the best answer from the given choices.

1. Let $L$ be a line on a plane. What is the slope of the line that intersects $L$ and some point $P$ along the shortest possible distance between them?
	**A.**	The slope of $L$
	**B.**	The negative of the slope of $L$
	**C.**	The negative reciprocal of the slope of $L$
	**D.**	Cannot be determined with the given information

2. Consider the equation for an **ellipse**:
   $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} = 1$$
   Which of the following conditions is a requirement for the ellipse to be a **circle**?
	**A.** $a = -b$
	**B.**	$a = b$
	**C.**	Neither of the two foci must lie at the center
	**D.**	$h = k$

**III. Problem solving.**

**Problem 1.** Find the solution sets for the following.

1.
$$
|4x - 2| \leq 10
$$

2.
$$
|x^2 + 4x + 4| > 0
$$

3.
$$
\frac{5}{9 - x} + \frac{3}{x + 9} + \frac{3x + 8}{x^2 - 81} = 0
$$

4.
$$
\frac{8}{x + 3} - \frac{27}{9x + 81} = \frac{x+3}{x^2 + 12x + 27} + \frac{5}{x + 9}
$$

**Problem 2.** Find the domain and range of the following function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{x + 9}{x - 4}
$$

**Problem 3.** Find the domain of the following function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 9}}{x + 10}
$$

**Problem 4.** Prove the change-of-base identity, that is:

$$
\log_b{x} = \frac{log_a{x}}{log_a{b}}
$$

**Problem 5.** Determine the center, vertices, and foci of the ellipse described by the following relation:

$$
\frac{(x - 5)^2}{81} + \frac{(y + 2)^2}{49} = 1
$$

**Problem 6.** Find the values of all six trigonometric functions of $\theta$ given each of the following conditions.

1.
$$
\cot{\theta} = \frac{3}{4}, \
\pi < \theta < 2\pi
$$

2.
$$
\sin{\theta} = \frac{4}{5}, \
0 < \theta < \pi
$$

**Problem 7.** Show that the following identities hold.

1.
$$
(1 - \cos^2{x})(1 + \cot^2{x}) = 1
$$

2.
$$
\frac{\sec^2{\theta} - 1}{\sec^2{\theta}} = \sin^2{\theta}
$$
