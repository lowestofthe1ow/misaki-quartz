**I. Sinusoids**.

1. **True or false**. A signal of the form $A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$ will oscillate between $+A$ and $0$.
2. **True or false**. The phase $\phi$ represents a direct shift in the input $t$ (that is, $\phi = 5$ means that $t$ is increased by $5$).
3. A sinusoidal signal was measured to be able to complete three full cycles in a second. It was recorded to have a peak amplitude of $5$ at some time $t_m = 2$ seconds. Construct the formula describing this signal using a phase shift, not a time shift.

For problems 4 to 7, refer to the following sinusoidal signal.

4. What is the amplitude?
5. What is the period?
6. What is the radial frequency and the frequency in Hz?
7. Express the above signal mathematically in terms of $t$, $\sin$, $t_0$, $t_d$, and $B$.

**II. Complex numbers and Euler's formula.**

8. A complex number is multiplied by $j^9$. Find the net angle of the rotation that occurred.
9. Show that $\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$ using Euler's formula.
10. Show that the product of a complex number and its conjugate equals the square of its magnitude.
11. Prove the inverse Euler's formulas, i.e., that for a complex number $z$: $$\begin{align*}\cos \theta = \frac{e^{j\theta} + e^{-j \theta}}{2} && \sin \theta = \frac{e^{j\theta} - e^{-j \theta}}{2j} \end{align*}$$
12. Let $z$ be some complex number with an angle $\theta = 30 \deg$. Find a value of $n$ such that $\Re \{ z^n \} = 0$.
13. For what $n$ is $-1$ a root of unity? For what $n$ is $j$ a root of unity?
14. Find the roots of unity for $n = 7$.
15. Show that the sum of the roots of unity for any $n$ is necessarily zero.
16. Find a complex number that, when multiplied to another, will rotate that complex number 30 degrees counterclockwise.
17. Find the complex conjugate $z^*$ of $z = 4 - j4\sqrt{3}$. Express the answer in polar form.
18. A complex number $h$ has a magnitude $|h| = 5$ and an imaginary part $\Im \{h\} = 4$. Find the real part of its conjugate $\Re \{h^*\}$.
19. Divide the complex number $4 + j19$ by $-5 - j2$.
20. The complex number $m = 5\sqrt{3} + j5$ is flipped about the real axis to form $m^*$. Find the Cartesian representation of the complex number $s$ such that $sm^* = m$.

**III. Complex exponentials and phasor addition.**

For problems 21 to 24, use phasor addition to represent the given sums as a **single** cosine signal.

21. $$\cos\left(10x+\frac{\pi}{6}\right)+\cos\left(10x-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$$
22. $$7\cos\left(20x+\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+4\cos\left(20x-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)$$

23. $$\cos\left(5x+\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+\cos\left(5x-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)+\cos\left(5x+\frac{\pi}{6}\right)$$

24. $$5\cos(\omega t+90\deg) + 5\cos(\omega t-30\deg) + 5\cos(\omega t - 120\deg)$$

For problems 25 to 27, refer back to the same sinusoidal signal shown for problems 4 to 7.

25. Express the signal as a complex exponential (in terms of $t$, $t_0$, $t_d$, and $B$) and find the complex amplitude.
26. Use the inverse Euler's formulas to express the signal as the sum of two conjugate complex exponentials.
27. Suppose that this signal is shifted some constant $c$ units to the **right**. What is the complex amplitude of this shifted signal?

**IV. Spectrum representation.**

For problems 28 to 30, find the spectrum representation of the given sums.

28. $$3\cos\left(200\pi x+\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + 2\sin\left(300\pi x+\frac{\pi}{6}\right)$$

29. $$4\cos\left(100\pi t + \frac{\pi}{6}\right) + 2\sin\left(250\pi t - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 3\cos\left(400\pi t + \frac{\pi}{8}\right)$$

30. $$5\cos\left(150\pi t + \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 3\sin\left(150\pi t - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + 4\cos\left(300\pi t + \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$$

For problems 31 to 33, let $x(t)$ be the same sum of sinusoids given in problem 30. Find the spectrum representations for the following:

31. $x(t) + c$
32. $\gamma x(t)$
33. $x(t-t_0)$
