## Voltage

**Voltage** is a force that pushes a current through a circuit, analogous to gravity acting on the water in a waterfall. Voltage is measured in **volts** ($V$).
<!--ID: 1743401725736-->

## Resistance

**Resistance** is the friction that impedes the flow of current through a circuit, analogous to rocks in a river. Resistance is measured in **ohms** ($\Omega$).
<!--ID: 1743401725738-->

## Current

**Current** is the actual substance flowing through the wires of the circuit (analogous to water). Current is measured in **amperes** (A).

### Conventional current and electron flow

**Conventional current** assumes that current flows out of the positive side of the battery. This is physically incorrect, but is a commonly used convention regardless. **Electron flow**, where electrons flow out of the negative side of the battery, is what actually occurs.

>[!info] CEETRN will follow the conventional current direction.

## Ohm's Law

**Ohm's law** relates the fundamental quantities of **current**, **voltage**, and **resistance**.

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

## Electrical power

**Power** describes the amount of **work** done per unit of time. It is given by:

$$
P = IV
$$

By Ohm's law, we obtain the following alternative equations:

$$
P = IV = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2R
$$
