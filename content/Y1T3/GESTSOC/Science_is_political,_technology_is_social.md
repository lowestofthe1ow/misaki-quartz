## Science

Science encompasses the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. It is involved with the outcomes of **tripartite human desires**:

1. To **survive** nature
2. To **source** nature
3. To **surpass** nature

### Scientism

**Scientism** is the notion that there is an inherent divide between **facts** and **values**, intrinsically different categories of phenomena. In other words, contemplative thought and practical action should be separated. Scientism demands bracketing of values and study only facts and implies the following:
- Superiority of facts over values in terms of credibility and cognitive authority.
- Only scientists can aptly participate in technical matters.
- Value-free and politically neutral therefore the best possible arbiters of controversy to reveal unbiased truth

## Technology

Technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes.

### Technological progressivism

Progress becomes synonym for good, and technology viewed as tool in progressive projects. Views technology as self-propelling along a singular path without human intervention.
