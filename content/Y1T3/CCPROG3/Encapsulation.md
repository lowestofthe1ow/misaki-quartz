## Encapsulation

Bundling data and actions withing a class without need to be exposed to other classes. It is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming. Other objects must not be able to directly read or edit data stored in other objects.
Most languages allow for the public exposition of data, but program design should consistently look to enforce the principle of encapsulation.

Abstraction is the result of encapsulation. Hiding information leads to hiding the complexities regarding an object.
