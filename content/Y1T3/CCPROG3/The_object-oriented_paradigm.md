## Programming paradigm

A **programming paradigm** is a fundamental **style** of programming. It answers the question "How do I think about and solve a problem?" and serves as the **philosophy** or basis for solving problems through programming. Examples include:

- Procedural programming
- Functional programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Logical programming

### Procedural programming

In **procedural programming**, as the name suggests, focus is placed on the **process**. Programs are instruction-driven and have minimal abstractions. Code that repeats can be generalized to create [[Functions_and_programs#Functions|procedures or subroutines]]. Data can typically be accessed anywhere in the program granted they are passed properly.

### Object-oriented programming

In **object-oriented programming**, as the name suggests, focus is placed on identifying objects and mapping how they interact with each other. This paradigm highly encourages **generalization** and **abstraction**. Objects can be composed of [[Variables_and_assignment|variables]] (**attributes** or **fields**) while performing some action (**methods**).

Object-oriented programming provides for more complex programming features, but with more complexity, greater effort is expected from the programmer. For instance, object-oriented programming allows for the modelling of complex relationships.

#### Classes

A **class** is a template or blueprint from which instances of objects may be created through **instantiation**.

#### Objects

Each **object** is an instance of a class and has its own copy of the attributes. This instance **will** act in the way that the class was designed.

## Programming language

A **programming language** is influenced by one or more programming paradigms, but need not apply all the philosophies of said paradigms.
