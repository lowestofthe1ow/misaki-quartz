## Algorithm

An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes value/s as **input** and produces some value/s as **output** in a **finite** amount of time. It is thus a sequence of computational steps that **transform** the input into the output.

### Computational problem

The statement of the problem specifies in **general** terms the desired input/output relationship for problem instances. An **instance** of the problem consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.

## Analyzing algorithms

**Analyzing** an algorithm involves studying its **behavior** and predicting its **performance**. This is useful to assess an algorithm without implementing it and to compare different algorithms to determine the best one for the purpose. Specifically, it answers the following questions:
- What happens as the input size gets larger?
- How much resources (**time** and **memory**) are used?
>[!warning] It is not possible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm. There are too many factors. Analysis is just an approximation; it is **not perfect**.

### A posteriori analysis

**A posteriori analysis** is an empirical analysis of an algorithm where the program is implemented using a programming language and executed on an actual machine.
