## Rolle's Theorem

**There is a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$** if $f$ is a function that satisfies the following conditions:
1. $f$ is [[Continuity#Continuity at a closed interval|continuous on the closed interval]] $[a,b]$
2. $f$ is [[Derivatives#Differentiability|differentiable]] on the open interval $(a,b)$
3. $f(a)=f(b)$

## Mean Value Theorem

**There is a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that**:
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
$$
if $f$ is a function that satisfies the following conditions:
1. $f$ is [[Continuity#Continuity at a closed interval|continuous on the closed interval]] $[a,b]$
2. $f$ is [[Derivatives#Differentiability|differentiable]] on the open interval $(a,b)$
