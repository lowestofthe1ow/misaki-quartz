## Money lending

An **investor** lends money to a **debtor**.

The **debtor** pays back money to the **investor**, where the money paid back is the originally borrowed money plus an additional sum called **interest**, which can be seen as "rent on money".

From the investor's point of view, interest is **income from invested capital**.

From the debtor's point of view, interest is **money paid for the use of money**.

### Principal $P$

The **principal** is the originally borrowed money
<!--ID: 1709742106973-->

### Amount of future value $F$

The sum of the principal and the interest:

$$
F = P + I
$$

## Simple interest

The interest is computed based on the **original principal**:

$$
I = Prt
$$

where $I$ is the interest, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the simple interest rate per unit of time, and $t$ is the total time.

### Future value of simple interest

$$
F = P + Prt \equiv F = P(1 + rt)
$$

## Compound interest

Interest is added to the original principal and the sum becomes the new principal that earns interest.

$$
F = P(1 + i)^n
$$
